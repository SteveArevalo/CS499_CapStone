## About This Portfolio

This repository serves as my professional Computer Science ePortfolio and capstone submission for Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights my academic and technical growth across software engineering, data structures and algorithms, database systems, analytics, and security. All artifacts contained within this repository were developed or enhanced as part of my undergraduate Computer Science program and collectively demonstrate my readiness for a data engineering role.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in shaping my professional goals and preparing me for a career as a data engineer. Throughout the program, I gained hands-on experience designing, analyzing, and enhancing systems that manage, process, and extract value from data. The capstone experience required me to critically reflect on my coursework, refine technical artifacts, and intentionally demonstrate how my skills align with industry expectations. This process strengthened my technical confidence, clarified my professional values around data quality and system reliability, and positioned me to be immediately employable in data-focused engineering roles.

Collaboration and communication were emphasized consistently throughout my coursework and project work. In team-based assignments, I worked within structured development environments that required task coordination, shared ownership of deliverables, and iterative feedback. These experiences reinforced the importance of collaboration when building reliable software and data systems. I also developed strong stakeholder communication skills by producing technical documentation, project narratives, and data-driven explanations tailored to non-technical audiences. For example, in database and analytics coursework, I learned how to clearly explain trends, metrics, and system behavior so that stakeholders could make informed decisions based on the data rather than the implementation details.

The program significantly strengthened my understanding of **data structures and algorithms** and their role in building efficient, scalable systems. Through applied coursework, I evaluated algorithmic performance using Big-O notation and implemented data structures that optimize data access and processing. This is exemplified by my enhancement of a Binary Search Tree into a self-balancing AVL Tree, which improved worst-case performance from **O(n)** to **O(log n)**. This experience reflects my ability to evaluate trade-offs in design decisions and implement algorithmic solutions that scale as data volume increases—an essential skill for data engineering.

My **software engineering and database skills** were developed through projects that required designing maintainable architectures and managing data across multiple layers of a system. In my *Inventory Management App*, originally developed for **Mobile Architecture and Programming**, I enhanced the application by refactoring it to follow the **MVVM architectural pattern**. This improvement separated concerns between the user interface, business logic, and data layer, improving maintainability, scalability, and testability. Similarly, my database-focused work in **CS 340 – Client/Server Development** expanded a MongoDB-backed application beyond basic CRUD operations by incorporating aggregation pipelines and Python-based analytics. This enhancement transformed the system into a data-driven application capable of identifying trends and supporting operational decision-making.

**Security awareness** was integrated throughout my coursework and project enhancements, shaping how I approach system and data design. I developed an understanding of access control, secure data handling, and potential vulnerabilities in software architecture. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, I applied a security mindset when designing data access layers, managing databases, and structuring application logic. This approach is especially relevant in data engineering roles, where protecting data integrity, privacy, and availability is critical.

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio collectively demonstrate the full range of my computer science skills and how they intersect in real-world applications. The **software engineering artifact** highlights my ability to design scalable and maintainable systems, the **algorithms and data structures artifact** demonstrates performance optimization and analytical reasoning, and the **database and analytics artifact** showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. Together, these projects illustrate my readiness to contribute as a data engineer by building secure, efficient, and data-driven solutions. This professional self-assessment serves as an introduction to the technical artifacts that follow and reflects my preparation to deliver value in modern, data-centric computing environments.
