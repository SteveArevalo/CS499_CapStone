    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my Computer Science program at SNHU, I developed skills in Python, Java, C++, SQL, and data visualization. 
      I completed several projects involving dashboards, database management, and algorithm design. 
      Completing my ePortfolio helped me reflect on my learning and solidify my goal to become a Data Engineer.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>CS300: Course Planner</h3>
      <p>
        In my CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms project, originally created during the course to manage university courses and their prerequisites. The program was designed to load course information, organize it for efficient retrieval, and allow the user to search and display prerequisite relationships. I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it represents one of my strongest demonstrations of working directly with fundamental data structures, algorithmic thinking, and performance-based decision making. Key components that showcase these skills include my transition from a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation to an enhanced AVL tree structure, which ensures balanced insertion, faster lookup times, and consistent performance even with larger datasets. This enhancement strengthened the artifact by replacing a linear-degrading structure with a self-balancing tree, improving efficiency and demonstrating my ability to apply algorithms to real-world data problems.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>CS340: Client Server Application</h3>
      <p>
        CS-340 Animal Shelter project, originally implemented a functional CRUD-based dashboard that allowed users to search, filter, create, update, and delete records in a MongoDB database of shelter animals. For this enhancement, I expanded the system to include a data mining and analytics component that provides insight into adoption trends. This included adding new analytical methods to the backend, implementing aggregation pipelines, and visualizing adoption patterns directly in the Jupyter Notebook. I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it represents a meaningful progression from basic software development toward creating data-driven systems. The original project demonstrated my foundational skills in Python programming, the Dash framework, and MongoDB interactions. However, the enhanced version goes further by showing my ability to integrate analytics, work with non-relational databases at a deeper level, and derive insights that support organizational decision-making. The new analytical components—such as the analyze_adoptions() and seasonal_adoption_trends() methods—highlight my skills in data wrangling, aggregation, visualization, and interpretation. By combining back-end data processing with front-end presentation, the artifact illustrates my capability to design full-stack solutions that transform raw data into actionable knowledge.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>CS360: Warehouse Application</h3>
      <p>
        I included my Warehouse Inventory Management Application in my ePortfolio because it represents a major milestone in my development as a software engineer. While the original version of the project successfully met its functional requirements, it was built using a tightly coupled structure where the user interface, business logic, and data operations all existed within a single class. This design worked initially, but it also highlighted why tightly coupled systems are not preferred in professional software development. Tightly coupled code is harder to maintain, more difficult to test, and limits the ability to introduce new features without risking unintended side effects.
Through the enhancement process, I transitioned the application to MVVM architecture, which embraces loose coupling, the preferred method in modern software engineering. By separating the system into independent layers (Model, View, and ViewModel), each component can change or expand with minimal impact on other parts of the system. This shift taught me firsthand how loosely coupled designs improve flexibility, support long-term scalability, and make it significantly easier to debug or update functionality. Implementing a Repository layer and reactive data handling through LiveData reinforced how professional applications manage data flow cleanly and efficiently.
